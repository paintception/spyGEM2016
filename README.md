#Modeling the impact of random mutations in Bacillus subtilis

The program has been built for the iGEM Groningen 2016 team and aims to investigate the role of random mutations on a particular bacteria's DNA.
If you want to know more about the project and the idea behind the software be sure to visit our website: http://2016.igem.org/Team:Groningen
In order to run the program be sure to have installed python 2.7 on your computer together with the random, copy and numpy libraries.
Be also aware of having in the directory the .txt file of the bacteria's DNA.
To launch the simulation run python dna_analysis.py

**Have fun from Matthia and the whole iGEM Groningen 2016 team!!!!**
